May 2nd 2019

### Compile:

	javac DecTree.java

### Run:

	java DecTree
  
When the main file (***DecTree.java***) is compiled, the secondary folder (***Config.java***) is compiled as well.

After compiling, the program is intuitive and provides step-by-step instructions.

Once the program asks for the name of a file please supply its extension.
**Example:**
```bash
weather.csv
```

Please make sure that the file you use is in the same directory as the rest of the implementation
